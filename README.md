# Raytracer

This is a basic raytracer that can render planes, spheres, and 3D models. It also supports point lights and directional lights.

You can:
- Move the camera with WASD
- Toggle the rendering of shadows with F2
- Cycle through the different lighting modes with F3

In this project I used `std::execution::par` when rendering individual pixels to achieve better performance.
